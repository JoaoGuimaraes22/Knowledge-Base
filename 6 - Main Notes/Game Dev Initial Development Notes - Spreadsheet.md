# Learning Process

- Watch tutorial -> NOTE everything relevant -> Actually understand
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ue0sjW3YXSc
- **Goal: LEAVE TUTORIAL HELL**
- STEP 1:
	- Knowledge is useless 
- STEP 2:
	- Hunt experience by searching for practices
- STEP 3:
	- Spreadsheet for learning columns:
		- Practice 
		- Do I understand fully what happened? 
		- Category (Interface, system design, protocol, pattern implementation, etc)
		- Pros (What pros of using can I see?)
		- Cons
		- Outcome (What was achieved with it?)
		- Alternative ways (to achieve this?)
		- How can I apply it? (Do I see a way to use it my project?)

# First Step
- Open a video - destroy it with attention
- Fill out all of the "Practice"
- Write as much shit as you can brag - EVERYTHING you can see and define as a small isolated action or trait
- Ex: ![[Pasted image 20251111093012.png]]
- Deconstruct a tutorial into atoms
- Every single tiny thing can enhance your workflows
- It will be a SLOW process

# Second Step
- Begin filling out all of the other columns 
- The most important is - **Do I understand fully what happened?**
	- Most will be NO, and that's OK
	- If YES:
		- Skip category? (not sure)
		- Fill Pros & Cons
		- If I agree with it, go to the adoption column
	- If NO:
		- Try to guess/understand the category
		- Fill the keywords column
		- Research the *shit* of it until I can fill the I understand column

# What to do if 0 knowledge
- Copy/recreate a tutorial project
- Recreate/refactor a tutorial
- Use alternative patterns
- Abstain from opinions about being "right" and analyse what feels the best
# Godot specific tips
- Learn the Editor, APIs, Interfaces, every tab, every menu
- Use and read the documentation, ctrl + clicking all you can see
